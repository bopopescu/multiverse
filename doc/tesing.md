## Goal

Increase software quality and confidence in our deployments.

## Description

This PR specifies the enhancements that we'll do to our testing ecosystem. Right now we have following tests in our system:

- Unit tests (Go Backend & SDKs)
- Acceptance tests (SDKs)
- Runscope acceptance tests (Hosted external service)
- PAW tests (Manually executable API requests)

The main discussion will be around wether to use an external solution or build our own. The scenarios will be added to our wiki as a deliverable.

#### Timeline
(times in UTC)

- **2016-03-30 17:26:00**: Rollout of build 1838 including 52ab788 (Migrate connection endpoints)
- **2016-03-30 21:36:00**: Michael reports crash of Stepz app with the following [stacktrace](https://gist.github.com/xla/a4df0daa03568d8f1c2e7bccb0ec7252)
- **2016-03-30 22:01:13**: Rollout of build 1839 including 5e05eb8 (Fix connection response)
- **2016-03-30 22:02:00**: Verification of the bug fix and input from Michael showed inconsistent results
- **2016-03-30 22:17:00**: Rollout of build 1840 including 161f547 (Use correct field for FromID list)

#### Impact

Two noticeable degradations have been observed:

* Opening the friends screen the app resulted in a hard crash.
* After the first deploy the friends screen showed inconsistent results which would include the current user and some friends were missing.

#### Cause

During the move to our new code architecture for connections all list responses which included user references have been adapted to follow the general API style of returning the users as a map. The old implementation was exceptional in that regard as it returned a list of users. As this wasn't an expected data format the client code concerned with decoding the payload could not recover.

A wrong reference in the code that compiles the user ids for connections where the user is the target prevented to include all friends of a user and instead included the current user in the list of user references.

#### Action Items

- [x] Fix FromID list
- [ ] Bring Runscope smoke test suit up-to-date to catch incosistent responses befoe/during deploy
- [ ] Increase code coverage for user id listings

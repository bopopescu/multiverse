#### Timeline
(times in UTC)

- **2016-05-03 19:44:00**: Rollout of build 1987 including c9847e8 (Rewrite user endpoitns)
- **2016-03-30 19:49:00**: Monitoring and Logging report increased error rate
- **2016-03-30 22:51:00**: Rollback to build 1956

#### Impact

Two noticeable degradations have been observed:

* All requests which involved a user with a number in their metadata failed with a serialisation error.
* The [logs](https://tapglue.loggly.com/search#terms=json.response.statusCode%20%3E%3D%20500%20OR%20json.status_code%20%3E%3D%20500&from=2016-05-03T19%3A46%3A11.692Z&until=2016-05-03T19%3A54%3A13.948Z&source_group=&filter=tag%3Bservice.prod.eu-central-1) show `1432` events.

#### Cause

During the rollout of the user endpoints the move to a new user implementation treated metadata as a `map[string]string`, which breaks for Stepz as they store counters as numbers.

#### Action Items

- [ ] Allow numbers in metadata

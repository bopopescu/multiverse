# Magneto (Signals 2.1943)

Wherein we describe the high-level product outline, document the research for technical feasability and available options of technologies like frameworks, IaaS and alike which could make up the technology stack.

### Product

Generally positioned to be an engagement tool it's aim is to increase retention for mobile applications address the following existing shortcomings:

* low notification open rates
* low post open engagement
* app content and their relations are not usable in existing systems
* difficult to build smart notifications beyond coarse segments

At the core of Magneto is the hypothesis that open rates and following session length can be increased by targeting single user with relevant content recommendations with expecte impact of:

* **Open Rate**: +XX% **TODO**
* **Notification session length**: +XX% **TODO**
